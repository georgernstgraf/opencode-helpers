# Task: Assess Student Submissions

In this directory, you will find the submissions which students have handed
in. The "knowledge-" files contain the questions and their respective
solutions. Please create a Markdown file "ASSESSMENT.md" (in german) with the
evaluations of each student (ordered alphabetically, by student, not by
grade).

I am especially interested in the most common errors of the class in order to
address them subsequently

Please integrate a comprehensive Table showing e.g.

- 5. Conti, Maximilian, Punkte: 5/12 (42%) Genügend
- 11. Hammermüller, Sophia, Punkte: 10/12 (83%) Sehr Gut

... in the Austrian grading system.
