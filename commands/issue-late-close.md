We have done some work without an issue on github and it now looks completed.

So please:

- create a new issue with a suitable title.
- reflect our thoughts and plans in the description.
- comment the issue with your implementation report.
- close the github issue
- commit the current state of the working copy with a mention of the new issue number (#) in the commit msg.
- push to remote
