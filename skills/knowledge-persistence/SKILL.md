# Knowledge Persistence Skill

## Purpose

This skill extracts the agent's accumulated understanding from the current
session and persists it into a structured set of knowledge files on disk.
Use this skill at any checkpoint during or at the end of a productive
session, or when explicitly asked to "save context", "persist knowledge",
or "update knowledge file".

## Target Structure

Ensure the following directory and files exist relative to the project root.
Create any missing files. Never delete entries from HISTORY.md (it is
an append-only archive). Do delete superseded entries from active files
by relocating them to HISTORY.md.

```text
docs/ai/
├── HANDOFF.md
├── DECISIONS.md
├── ARCHITECTURE.md
├── CONVENTIONS.md
├── PITFALLS.md
├── DOMAIN.md
├── STATE.md
└── HISTORY.md
```

**Active files** (must match current HEAD; no superseded entries):
HANDOFF.md, DECISIONS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONVENTIONS.md, PITFALLS.md,
DOMAIN.md, STATE.md.

**Historical file** (chronological sink; superseded entries EXPECTED here):
HISTORY.md.

## Protocol

### 1. Discovery

- Read all existing files in `docs/ai/` to understand what is
  already persisted.
- If the directory does not exist, create it.
- If a file does not exist, create it with the template in
  [FILE-TEMPLATES.md](./FILE-TEMPLATES.md).

### 2. Diff Against Session

- Review the full conversation history of the current session.
- For each knowledge file, identify facts, decisions, patterns, or status
  changes that emerged during this session and are NOT yet in the file.
- Ignore transient chatter, failed attempts that were fully superseded,
  and speculative discussion that did not lead to a conclusion.

### 3. Write Updates

- Append new entries to the appropriate file.
- If an existing entry is now outdated, MOVE it to HISTORY.md (do not
  leave superseded content in active files).
- Never duplicate an entry that already exists.
- Write only facts. One item per bullet. No preamble, no commentary,
  no summaries at the top of the file.

### 3b. Prune Superseded Entries

For each active file being updated, scan for entries that no longer
match current reality:

- Entries contradicted by current code or configuration.
- Entries superseded by a later decision or implementation.
- Entries describing a reverted or removed change.

For each superseded entry found:

1. **Remove** it from the active file.
2. **Append** it to `HISTORY.md` with a header:
   `## YYYY-MM-DD (SUPERSEDED YYYY-MM-DD, origin: <FILE>, reason: <why or #NNN>): <Title>`
3. Include the original entry text below the header, plus one line
   noting the origin file and the reason it was superseded.
4. Leave a ONE-LINE pointer in the active file ONLY if a future reader
   would otherwise re-discover the same pitfall; otherwise delete
   cleanly.

**PITFALLS.md special case**: Distinguish between:
- **(a) Permanent non-obvious constraints** (e.g., "Room validates
  PRAGMA table_info, PK must be NOT NULL") — these stay in active
  PITFALLS.md.
- **(b) Bugs that were fixed** (e.g., "clearText+typeText race, fixed
  in #254") — these MOVE to HISTORY.md once the fix ships. Their value
  is historical, not advisory.

**Status-tag convention**: For active-file entries with a known
lifecycle (e.g., a workaround slated for removal), append an optional
trailing tag `[ACTIVE until #NNN]` so a future pruner knows to
relocate it.

### 4. Rewrite `ARCHITECTURE.md` (if structural changes occurred)

- Determine whether the session introduced any structural changes:
  new/removed/renamed commands, skills, knowledge files, or significant
  changes to data flows, dependencies, or component relationships.
- If no structural changes occurred, skip this step and leave
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` unchanged.
- If structural changes did occur, **overwrite** `docs/ai/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  with the current system snapshot using the template in
  [FILE-TEMPLATES.md](./FILE-TEMPLATES.md).
- Like STATE.md, this file is overwritten (not appended) because it
  represents a point-in-time structural map, not a chronological log.

### 5. Write `HANDOFF.md`

- Check the task list maintained during this session.
- If any tasks are still [PENDING] or [IN PROGRESS], write them to
  `docs/ai/HANDOFF.md` using the template in
  [FILE-TEMPLATES.md](./FILE-TEMPLATES.md).
- Include: the current branch, each open task with file paths and
  line numbers where applicable, and any context the next agent
  needs to avoid re-discovery.
- If all tasks are complete, clear the file body and write only:
  `No pending tasks. Last cleared: YYYY-MM-DD.`

#### Escalation Rule

- If an open task would require more than ~30 minutes of agent work,
  do NOT put it in HANDOFF.md alone.
- **GitHub-Projekte:** Create a GitHub issue:
  `gh issue create --title "<title>" --body "<body>"`. In HANDOFF.md,
  reference only the issue number:
  `1. [ ] See #42 — Refactor enrollment module to cursor pagination`
- **SVN-Projekte ohne Issue-System** (z. B. `~/svn/georg`, Deployed-Trees auf
  murl/claw): es existiert KEIN Issue-Tracking — solche Aufgaben bleiben
  vollständig in HANDOFF.md (mit Datei-/Pfad-Angabe); kein `gh`-Aufruf.
- This keeps HANDOFF.md small and actionable while large work is
  properly tracked (via issues in GitHub, via HANDOFF.md in SVN).

### 6. Update `AGENTS.md`

- Ensure the project-level `AGENTS.md` (in project root or `.opencode/`)
  contains the bootstrap instruction block. If it does not, append it.

### 7. Comment on Active Issue (nur GitHub-Projekte; SVN: skip)

- **Anwendbarkeit:** nur für GitHub- (bzw. Git-)Projekte. In SVN-Projekten
  ohne Issue-System (`~/svn/georg` etc.) diesen Schritt still überspringen.
- If there is a known active GitHub issue for the current session, post a
  brief comment summarizing what knowledge was persisted (files updated,
  key additions). Example:
  `gh issue comment 42 --body "Knowledge persisted: added 3 entries to CONVENTIONS.md, updated STATE.md."`
- **NEVER close, reopen, or change the state of any issue.** This skill
  only adds comments for traceability.
- If no active issue is known, skip this step silently.

### 8. Confirmation

- After writing, list every file that was created or modified, and for each
  show the number of entries added, updated, or removed.

## File Templates and Content Rules

Templates and per-file content rules for `docs/ai/` are in
[FILE-TEMPLATES.md](./FILE-TEMPLATES.md). Use the template for a file when
creating or overwriting it.

## Constraints

- Write only verified facts from the session. Do not speculate.
- Keep entries atomic: one fact, one bullet.
- Active files: merge new entries, but DELETE superseded entries by
  relocating them to HISTORY.md. Never leave stale content in active
  files.
- HISTORY.md: append-only. Never delete or modify existing entries.
- Overwrite files: STATE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and HANDOFF.md are
  overwritten on each persistence run (not appended).
- If unsure whether something belongs in DECISIONS vs CONVENTIONS,
  apply this test: "Is this a one-time choice (DECISIONS) or an
  ongoing rule to follow (CONVENTIONS)?"
- If unsure whether something belongs in DECISIONS vs ARCHITECTURE,
  apply this test: "Is this a chronological record of a choice
  (DECISIONS) or a structural description of the current system
  (ARCHITECTURE)?"
- If unsure whether an entry is still valid, apply this test:
  "Is this still true in the current codebase? If not, it belongs
  in HISTORY.md, not the active file."
- Active files stay lean through the prune protocol (step 3b); no
  hard line limit is needed.
- HISTORY.md is append-only and will grow over time. If it exceeds
  ~500 lines, archive entries older than 6 months into
  `HISTORY-archive.md` (also append-only, same header format).
- **Issue Safety**: This skill is a documentation-only operation. It
  must NEVER close, reopen, or change the state of any GitHub issue.
  Issue lifecycle management is the exclusive responsibility of the
  `issue-workflow` skill's `finish` mode. When invoked standalone, this
  skill may only create new issues (Escalation Rule) or comment on
  existing ones. — gilt diesbezüglich nur für GitHub-Projekte;
  SVN-Projekte ohne Issue-System haben schlicht keine Issues (dann
  entfällt der ganze Mechanik still).
