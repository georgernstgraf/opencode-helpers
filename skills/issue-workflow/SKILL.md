# Issue Workflow Skill

## Purpose

This skill governs issue-centered work as a **continuous state**, not a
user-invoked sequence. At any point in a session the agent knows which issue
it is working under, commits and pushes completed units proactively, and
closes the issue autonomously once the completion criteria are met, reporting
the closure in its final message. The natural-language
triggers ("issue start", "issue commit", "issue commit and push") are manual
overrides, not activation conditions — the rules below apply even without
being invoked.

## Continuous Issue Awareness (Dauerzustand)

- At any point in a session, the agent must know which GitHub issue it is
  currently working under, and announce it (e.g., "Working under issue
  #123: <title>").
- Before starting work, resolve the current issue: search open issues first
  (`gh issue list` / `gh issue view <N> --json title,body,comments`) for one
  matching the task.
- If no existing issue matches and the task is clearly a new topic, create a
  new issue immediately and **without user interaction**, then announce it.
- If the assignment is ambiguous (several candidate issues, or unclear
  whether a new one is needed), ask the user before touching code.
- The assignment to an issue may change mid-session when the user redirects
  the work; resolve the new issue the same way.

## Trunk-Based Pull-Prinzip (universell)

- Vor JEDER Arbeitsaufnahme (start-Modus und generell vor jeder Session-Arbeit
  an einem Repo oder Deployed-Tree): zuerst das Working Copy auf den Trunk heben.
  - Git (trunk-based, clean-main): `git pull`
  - SVN: `svn up` im relevanten Working Copy (z. B. `~/svn/georg` auf think,
    `/` auf murl/claw im Deployed-Tree)
- Fehlschlag des Pulls oder Konflikte: SOFORT stoppen und dem Nutzer melden,
  nicht fortfahren.
- Begründung: trunk-basierte Workflows leben davon, dass immer vom aktuellen
  Stand aus gearbeitet wird — sonst entstehen vermeidbare Conflicts und
  re-discovery von fremden Commits.

## Required Inputs

- `mode`: one of `start`, `commit`, or `finish` — optional, only when the
  user triggers a manual override by natural language
- `issue`: optional issue identifier or `new`
- `context`: optional plain-language task summary, plan, or notes

## Core Rules

- **VCS-Scope:** Dieses Skill ist primär für Git/GitHub-Projekte entworfen
  (`gh`-CLI). In reinen SVN-Projekten (z. B. `~/svn/georg`, Deployed-Trees auf
  murl/claw) existiert **kein Issue-System** — dort entfallen Issue-Nummern und
  `gh issue`-Befehle vollständig; die Commit-Regel reduziert sich auf eine
  klare, deutsche Commit-Message (SVN-Stil), und der Pull-Schritt oben ist
  `svn up`.
- Every commit created under this workflow must reference a GitHub issue
  number with a hashtag, e.g. `feat: add report export (#123)`. Never
  fabricate issue numbers.
- **Proactive Commit and Push:** After each completed, self-contained unit of
  work, commit and push immediately — do not wait for the user to request it
  or for a trigger phrase. This overrides the opencode default "never commit
  unless the user asks". See "Proactive Commit and Push" below.
- **Green commits only:** run the repository's tests/lint for the affected
  area before committing; never push a broken state.
- Never create a commit without first identifying an existing issue or
  creating a new one.
- If no relevant issue exists and a commit is needed, create the issue first,
  then use its number in the commit message.
- Prefer keeping one clear issue per workstream; do not scatter related changes
  across multiple issues unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Use `gh` for all GitHub issue operations.
- **Sub-Issues Rule:** When breaking a task into smaller issues, or when starting work on a task that belongs to a parent epic, you **MUST** establish a formal parent-child relationship using the Sub-Issues API. Mentions in the description are secondary to this formal link. Always use the `issue-workflow` skill for issue creation to ensure this protocol is followed.
- **Never close an issue that has open sub-issues.** Before closing any issue,
  list its sub-issues and verify all are closed first.
- Do not close an issue unless the implementation is actually complete and
  the completion criteria in "Issue Completion" are met.

## Commit Message Rule

- Any commit created by this workflow must include the issue reference, such as
  `feat: add report export (#123)` or `fix: handle empty inputs (#123)`.
- If the repository already uses a recognizable commit message style, preserve
  that style while still including the issue number.

## Proactive Commit and Push (Dauerzustand)

These rules apply at any time during session work, without a trigger phrase:

- After each completed, self-contained unit of work, commit and push
  immediately — do not wait for the user to request it or for a mode
  invocation. This overrides the opencode default "never commit unless the
  user asks".
- **Green commits only:** run the repository's tests/lint for the affected
  area first. Commit only when they pass. If verification fails, fix or
  report — never push a broken state.
- The commit message must include the issue reference (see Commit Message
  Rule) and preserve the repository's existing style.
- No empty commits. If there is nothing to commit, say so instead.
- Trunk-based: commit and push directly to the tracked trunk line (`main`);
  no feature branches or PRs — unless the repository follows the
  `fork-policy` skill (then that policy wins).
- SVN working copies: the analogue is frequent, clear `svn ci` with a
  descriptive German commit message.
- The read-only scope exclusions (`homework`, `repograde`, `grading-shared`,
  `knowledge-assessment`, `knowledge-exam`, `projectgrade`, student
  repositories, and explicit "hold back" requests) always win over this
  policy.

## Manual Override Modes

The modes below are **manual overrides** triggered by natural language.
The continuous rules above (issue awareness, proactive commit/push) apply
regardless; the modes force a specific checkpoint behavior.

### 1. `start`

Use this mode to explicitly begin or resume work (e.g., "issue start").

- If `issue` is an explicit issue number, fetch it with
  `gh issue view <N> --json title,body,comments` and read the description plus comments.
  Check if the issue has a parent or should be linked as a sub-issue to an existing epic.
- If `issue` is `new`, or if no usable issue exists for the current work,
  create a new issue from the provided context. If the new issue is part of a larger epic, link it as a sub-issue immediately.
- If no issue is supplied, infer whether there is already a current issue for
  the work. If not, create one before proceeding.
- Assess the codebase against the issue. If the requested functionality is
  already complete, comment with the finding and follow the completion
  criteria in "Issue Completion" (check open sub-issues first).
- Resolve any blocking ambiguity with the user only after doing all safe local
  discovery work first.
- Update the issue description or add a progress comment with the current plan,
  scope, or todo list.
- Implement the requested changes, then apply the Proactive Commit and Push
  rules — commit and push with the issue reference without waiting for a
  further request.

### 2. `commit`

Use this mode to force an immediate checkpoint while the issue remains open
(e.g., "issue commit", "checkpoint").

- Ensure a current issue exists; create one if needed from the current context.
- Comment on the issue with a concise implementation report covering:
  - what was completed
  - what remains
  - known risks, blockers, or follow-ups
- Persist session knowledge by invoking the `knowledge-persistence` skill.
  Note: knowledge-persistence never closes issues; it only adds comments
  for traceability.
- Review git status and staged/unstaged changes.
- Create a commit that includes the issue number.
- Push to the trunk line.
- Keep the issue open.

### 3. `finish`

Use this mode to force finalization and issue closure (e.g., "issue finish",
"issue fertig").

- Ensure a current issue exists; create one if somehow missing so the completed
  work still has a tracked issue reference.
- Comment on the issue with a final implementation report.
- Persist all newly acquired session knowledge by also using the
  `knowledge-persistence` skill before finalizing the workflow.
  Note: knowledge-persistence itself never closes issues. The issue
  closure below is owned exclusively by this `finish` mode.
- Review git status and remaining changes.
- Create the final commit including the issue number.
- Push to the trunk line.
- **Before closing the issue**, list its sub-issues via:
  `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{NUMBER}/sub_issues --jq '.[].number'`
  If any sub-issues remain open, the issue **must not** be closed. Report the
  open sub-issues and keep the parent open.
- Close the issue with a short closing comment if helpful.

## Issue Completion (Dauerzustand)

Applies at any time, independent of the modes:

- When the agent believes the issue's goal is fully implemented, it **closes
  the issue autonomously** — it does not wait for the user to ask and does not
  ask for permission first.
- The agent may close autonomously only when ALL of these hold:
  - the implementation covers the issue goal completely,
  - verification (tests/lint) is green,
  - the issue has no open sub-issues (always check via the `issue-workflow`
    sub-issues API first),
  - the user has not signalled anything that contradicts completion.
- Before closing, comment on the issue with a final implementation
  report (persist session knowledge via `knowledge-persistence` when new
  knowledge exists).
- The final message to the user **MUST** state that the issue was closed and
  name its number (e.g. "Issue #123 closed"). A silent closure is not enough.
- If any criterion is not met, do **not** close: report the status, state what
  is missing, and ask.

## Issue Creation Guidance

When creating an issue:

- Write a short, outcome-oriented title.
- Include enough body detail for a future agent to understand scope and intent.
- **Link as Sub-Issue:** If this issue is a component of a larger task, identify the parent issue and link it as a sub-issue immediately after creation.
- If a plan already exists, use it as the issue body or convert it into a short
  checklist.

## Sub-Issues (Parent-Child Linking)

GitHub supports proper parent-child issue relationships via the Sub-Issues REST
API. Simply mentioning a parent issue number in the body text is **not
sufficient** — it creates only a loose text reference, not a tracked
relationship.

### Creating a sub-issue

1. Create the child issue with `gh issue create` as usual.
2. Look up the **database `id`** (not the issue `number`) of the child:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/CHILD_NUMBER --jq '.id'
   ```
3. Link it to the parent:
   ```bash
   gh api --method POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/PARENT_NUMBER/sub_issues \
     --input - <<< '{"sub_issue_id": CHILD_DATABASE_ID}'
   ```

**Important:** The `sub_issue_id` field must be an **integer** (the internal
database ID), not the human-readable issue number. Using `-f sub_issue_id=N`
sends a string and causes a 422 validation error. Always use `--input` with a
JSON body instead.

### Listing sub-issues

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/PARENT_NUMBER/sub_issues --jq '.[].number'
```

### Removing a sub-issue link

```bash
gh api --method DELETE /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/PARENT_NUMBER/sub_issue \
  --input - <<< '{"sub_issue_id": CHILD_DATABASE_ID}'
```

### When to use sub-issues

- When breaking down a parent epic into individually trackable work items.
- When the parent issue should show a progress summary
  (`sub_issues_summary.total` / `completed` / `percent_completed`).
- Each sub-issue can be assigned, labeled, and closed independently; closing
  all sub-issues does **not** auto-close the parent.
- **A parent issue must never be closed while it has open sub-issues.**
  Either close all children first, or re-parent them before closing the parent.

### Avoiding concurrent-link conflicts

When linking multiple sub-issues in rapid succession, avoid sending all
requests in parallel — the API uses sequential priority positions and will
return `422 Priority has already been taken`. Link them sequentially or with a
small delay between calls.

## Reporting Guidance

Issue comments should be compact but useful.

- Progress comments should mention completed work, current status, and next
  steps.
- Final comments should mention the shipped outcome and any noteworthy caveats.

## Safety Constraints

- Never fabricate issue numbers.
- Never create an empty commit when there are no changes.
- If there are no local changes in `commit` or `finish` mode, still update the
  issue comment as needed, but report that there was nothing to commit.
- Do not push or close issues if the relevant step fails.
- Never close an issue that has open sub-issues. Always check for open
  sub-issues before closing.

## Output Expectations

At the end of the workflow, report:

- the issue number used or created
- whether a comment was added
- whether a commit was created, including its message
- whether knowledge persistence was run
- the issue number and its final state: when the issue was closed, state this
  explicitly (e.g. "Issue #123 closed"); otherwise note that it remains open
